[$PlayerName]: [$Char4First]? Are you in there? It’s me, [$PlayerName]…
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: Yes, come in!
Skip:
[$PlayerName]: (tentatively, slowly) Ok, I’m coming in… Just opening the door… 
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: You can come in.
Skip:
[$PlayerName]: **(enters)** So! [$Char4First], I just want to apologize for the other day, barging in here like that. I know this is your home and I want to respect your privacy. I should have got your consent before entering.
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: Mistakes happen. I wasn’t upset with you walking in on Fred and I… If anything it’s been your behaviour since then that I find a bit annoying.

[$Char4Last] You have been avoiding me since came into my room the other day, and to be honest it comes across to me as being quite childish. Do you have a problem with my relationship with Fred?
[[No! Of course not!|Sexuality2_NO]]
[[It’s just… I don’t really think of the residents that way|Sexuality2_YES]]

[$PlayerName]: **Flustered** I think it’s great that you and Fred are… a couple.
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: We’re not a couple! Don’t go telling people that!
Skip:
[$PlayerName]: No! I’m sorry! I mean, it’s great that you guys are… whatever you are… I’m sorry! I’m trying not to be weird!
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: Well you’ll have to try harder! Fred and I have a casual, sexual relationship, and we’re mature enough to handle that. 
Skip:
[$PlayerName]:Totally! I just have never known anyone your age to be, like, active that way… I didn’t think of you that way. I think about you like my grandparents.
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: Do you think seniors stop being intimate after a certain age? Or do you just not want to think about it?

[[I guess I don't really think about it|END]]
[[I suppose I thought older adults just stop doing that stuff eventually|END]]
[[Maybe both|END]]

[$Char4Last]: What way?
Skip:
[$PlayerName]: (Flustered) I’m sorry! I’m trying not to be weird!
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: Well, you’ll have to try harder! Fred and I have a casual, sexual relationship, and we’re mature enough to handle that. Are you? 
Skip:
[$PlayerName]: Totally! I just have never known anyone your age to be, like, active that way. I didn’t think of you that way and I guess it’s kind of a weird adjustment. I think about you like my own grandparents.
Skip:
[$Char4Last]: Do you think older adults stop being intimate after a certain age?
